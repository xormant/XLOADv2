This is my first ever project that I consider an actual project which I completed like 3 months ago, when I first started taking development serious, so yes the code is fairly sloppy and there is some inconsistencies but it is functional, and the UI is appreciatable.

This program is made to detect DDoS attacks and capture them, returning data through Discord or Telegram (optional) with the stats of the attack.
